# team_sieg_build_for_women
This is a team Hackathon For the Topic Build for Women Organised By Dev Cluster

## Basic Idea

This Website Focuses on 3 problems
1)Financial problem:
Women might have Great startup ideas but may not have enough funds . So in this website we try to solve the problem by providing all the women the details of the government schemes and the incubation centers .
2)Lack of Motivation:
We live in a society that have given man high priority in many sectors of the working area and women, due to lack of exposure towards story of successful women, we arenâ€™t motivated to think out of the box. We provide Success stories of women who has achieved great heights so that they can work harder and achieve their dreams.
3)Lack of reach towards the community:
As There are many business startups very few have got their Acknowledgement towards their work so, we provide a platform that help this new startup/startups to bring light upon their work and help them to scale up to a broader market through advertisements on our page hence we also provide a link to their website.
In addition to this, We also have provided an A.I powered model which can help you predict the capital Investment Required for your Startup.
